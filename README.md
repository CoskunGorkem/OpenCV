# OpenCV

This repository includes basic tutorials/projects that I completed in past. I have tried to put a lot of comments to explain what is what. Hope that would be useful for you. 

What you will find is,
- Introduction to OpenCV Courses
- Mid-level tutorials
- Intermediate tutorials
- Real-world applications of OpenCV
- Image dataset manipulations
- Introduction to Image processing methods with AI
- How to train classification networks
- How to train object detection networks
- Combination of OpenCV and AI
- Official paper links for all the models and datasets that are used in all projects

Starting from the 1st of January, 2021, I will try to update the repository every day.

### Step-by-step Installation Instructions

Virtual Environment should be used whenever you work on any Python-based project. It is generally good to have one new virtual environment for every Python-based project you work on. So the dependencies of every project are isolated from the system and each other.

Please follow the below commands.
```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv --version
$ cd [where you want to create your environment]
$ python3 -m venv opencv_tutorials
$ . opencv_tutorials/bin/activate
$ cd [where you want to clonne the repository]
$ git clone https://github.com/CoskunGorkem/OpenCV.git
$ cd OpenCV
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
